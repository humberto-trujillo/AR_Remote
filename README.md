AR remote is a low cost remote control for virtual reality that gives the users the expirience of having their hand in the game. It communicates via UDP protocol to any smart phone capable of running virtual reality apps. By using the augmented reality framework Vuforia, we are able to provide the user almost fully postional tracking of the remote in the virtual world.

A ESP8266 micro controller, a joystick, some buttons, vuforia and Unity engine to interface it all.
